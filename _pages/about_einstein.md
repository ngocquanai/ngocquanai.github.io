## About Me

I am a final-year student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I have gained valuable experience working as a Research Assistant at the BKAI Laboratory and as an AI Resident at **VinAI Research** (mentored by [Prof. Trung Le](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le)), where I focused on topics including Bayesian Inference and Machine Learning Theory. Currently, I am an AI Research Resident at Qualcomm AI Research, my research will focus on **model fine-tuning** and **test-time scaling for large language model**.
